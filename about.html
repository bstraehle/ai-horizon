        <h1>AI HORIZON</h1>

        <p class="instructions">
          A fast, arcade-style space shooter — collect stars, blast asteroids, and beat the clock.
        </p>

        <h3>How to play</h3>
        <p class="instructions">
          Your goal is to score as many points as possible before the timer runs out. Move your ship
          to collect glowing stars and shoot incoming asteroids. Some asteroids are indestructible
          and take many hits — keep an eye on their shields. The game lasts one minute per run by
          default.
        </p>

        <h3>Controls</h3>
        <div class="instructions">
          <p>
            <strong>Move:</strong> Arrow keys or WASD — or point/touch the canvas to have the ship
            smoothly follow the cursor.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Fire:</strong> Spacebar, mouse button, or touch and hold — hold to continuously
            fire (rate-limited).
          </p>
          <p><strong>Pause / Resume:</strong> Esc (or the Pause button on-screen).</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Scoring</h3>
        <div class="instructions">
          <p>Points are awarded for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Regular asteroid: +10 points</li>
            <li>Indestructible asteroid (planet): +100 points</li>
            <li>Yellow star: +20 points</li>
            <li>Red bonus star: +50 points (appears periodically)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The game tracks high scores and displays a small leaderboard at the end of each run.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul class="instructions">
          <li>Prioritize red stars when you see them — they give the biggest score boost.</li>
          <li>
            Hold the fire button for continuous shooting, but note shots are rate-limited to prevent
            spamming.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use mouse or touch for precise positioning; keyboard gives full directional control when
            you prefer it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Aim for tight clusters of asteroids to get more points quickly, but avoid collisions —
            indestructible asteroids block bullets and take many hits.
          </li>
          <li>Watch the timer — each run is short, so focus on high-value targets early.</li>
        </ul>
